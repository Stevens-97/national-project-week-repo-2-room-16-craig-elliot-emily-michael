### Introduction

-   This project was originally made as a part of a project during my time as a bootcamper at [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/). I collaborated with three other developers to create a full stack application. This was then presented to a panel of professionals. Since then I have taken the project further, implementing skills learnt during my time as a junior developer.
